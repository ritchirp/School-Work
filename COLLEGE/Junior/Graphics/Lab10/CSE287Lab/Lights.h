* light is described as bounced light that has been scattered so much that it
* is impossible to tell the direction to its source. If using a LightSource 
* instantiation to simulate ambient light, the overall intensity of the light
* should be low in order to avoid washing out shadows as well as diffuse and 
* specular effects that can be achieved when using children of this struct.
